# GNN Tracking Hyperparameter Optimization 2.0

<!-- SPHINX-START -->

[![pre-commit.ci status](https://results.pre-commit.ci/badge/github/gnn-tracking/hyperparameter_optimization2/main.svg)](https://results.pre-commit.ci/latest/github/gnn-tracking/hyperparameter_optimization2/main)
[![Actions Status][actions-badge]][actions-link]

This repository hosts submission scripts and framework for hyperparameter
optimization of the models defined in [the main library][main library]. It is a
successor to [the original hyperparameter optimization
repository][original hpo repo] that became obsolete after the main library was
refactored to use [pytorch lightning][pylit].

## ‚ú® Features

- Configure your model with only [yaml][yaml] files
- Submission files for [SLURM][slurm]
- Upload your results to the [Weights & Biases][wandb] platform

## üó∫Ô∏è Layout of this repository

- `scripts`: This is the main content: All the config files and submission scripts
  to start training are here
- `bin`: Helper scripts that might be worth adding to your `$PATH` (i.e., that apply
  to all experiments/subprojects)
- `src/hpo2`: Python package with additional helper files that don't have a place
  in the main library (currently empty)

## üöÄ Installation

First, follow the instructions from [the main library][main library] to set up
the mamba environment and install the main library. Then run

```bash
pip3 install --editable '.[dev,testing]'
```

for this library.

For the helper scripts, install [xonsh][]:

```bash
pip3 install xonsh
xonsh link_bin.xsh
```
